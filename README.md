# Tracko
Tracko is a mobile application for Android built using [HyperTrack](https://github.com/hypertrack/live-app-android#:~:text=is%20built%20with-,HyperTrack,-.%20Developers%20can%20now) and enables its users' to obtain the live location of other users using Face Recognition. 

## Introduction
In situations where it is not feasible to call someone we're close to often but want to know their current location/live location for safety reasons, we can use this prototype to track the user's whereabouts by simply using a picture of them. 

## Face Recognition
Face Recognition technology is used in detecting a face from a digital image or video and matching the face against a database of faces. 

## Requirements
- Turn on Location
- Enable all Camera, Gallery and Location Permissions and set to 'Always Allow'
- Allow Location Tracking in Background
- Ensure that the application is downloaded on both the users' devices i.e, the user tracking and the user being tracked.
